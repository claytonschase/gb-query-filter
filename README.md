# GB Query Filter

GB Query Filter is a lightweight WordPress plugin that adds customizable
front-end filters to the GenerateBlocks Query Loop block. It enables
live filtering based on taxonomies, custom fields, sort order, and
search terms while maintaining full compatibility with GenerateBlocks
2.0+.

The plugin integrates with a custom block that links directly to the
Query Loop, supports optional AJAX filtering, and syncs all filter
states to the URL for shareable filter results.

## Features

### Front-End Filters

Supports filtering by: - Taxonomies - Meta fields (custom fields) - Sort
order - Search term

Filter control types include: - Select - Checkbox - Radio

Additional filter features: - Multiple selections - Default states -
Reset button - Option to disable front-end filters entirely

### Block-Based Integration

The plugin registers a custom block that connects to GenerateBlocks'
Query Loop. Users can configure: - Post types - Taxonomy filters - Meta
key filters - Sort options - Front-end filter behavior - AJAX
vs. full-page reload mode

### URL Parameter Sync

Filter states are synced to the URL using the GB Query Filter naming
pattern:

    ?gbqf_tax[category]=news,events
    ?gbqf_meta[color]=blue
    ?gbqf_sort=title_asc
    ?gbqf_search=steel+railings

On page load, the plugin restores all filter states from the URL.

### Optional AJAX Support

Two filtering modes are available: 1. Full page reloads 2. AJAX
filtering and pagination (if enabled)

## Admin Settings

The settings page is styled to mimic the GenerateBlocks admin UI. It
includes: - A centered container with a max width of 750px - Accordion
groups for organizing settings - A top navigation bar similar to
GenerateBlocks (Logo, Settings, Integrations) - Controls for choosing
which meta keys and taxonomies are available - Options to enable or
disable front-end filters

## URL Structure

## Developer Notes

-   Uses native WordPress block APIs, REST endpoints, and WP_Query
    modifications.
-   Does not modify GenerateBlocks core.
-   Filters only affect the inner post query of the Query Loop block.
-   Compatible with caching plugins when AJAX is disabled.
-   Designed for extensibility and future integrations.

## Roadmap

-   Additional filter UI layouts
-   Range sliders for numbers, price, or dates
-   Saved filter presets
-   Multiple filter groups per page
-   Integration with GenerateCloud pattern imports
